    "### Load InceptionV3\n",
    "\n",
    "When we load a network, we have a number of options we can set.  Some of the more important ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `input_shape`: Pretrained networks assume a particular image input size.  If your data is not this shape, Keras will allow you to set it here, but some models have limitations.  InceptionV3 cannot go below 75 by 75.\n",
    "* `weights`: What weights to load with the model.  Default is random weights or `'imagenet'`, which loads weights from training on the ImageNet dataset.  We will try the pretrained weights in a later section.\n",
    "* `include_top`: Include the dense layer at the end of the network?  If you are loading pre-trained weights, you will likely need to replace the top layer with your own.\n",
    "* `classes`: Number of classes to output.  Needed if `include_top` is True and `weights` is None.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first attempt, we'll start training the model from scratch.  Because we are dealing with such small images, we'll need to built a custom first layer to rescale the image up by a factor of 3.  We can do this using a `Lambda` layer, which lets us call backend (TensorFlow in this case) tensor manipulation functions.  Keras provides a `resize_images` function which will scale up the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also use the \"functional\" API of Keras here, where we connect one layer to the next by treating each layer like a function and passing the preceding layer to it."
